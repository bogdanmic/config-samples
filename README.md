config-samples
==============

This is collection of config files to use as samples for future work.

For now it contains:

 - a sample **basrc** file for **ubuntu 13.04** to make the terminal prompt colorful and add the branch name if in a **git** repository
 - a sample **application shortcut** file for **ubuntu 13.04** to make it available in the unity search application widget. This file needs to be placed in **/usr/share/applications/** folder
